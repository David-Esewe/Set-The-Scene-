SET THE SCENE


Overview of what you did

The project is called “Set the scene” it is a simple game where you try to set a scene with objects based on a picture. Originally I had an idea that was similar but more complex that focused on dementia. The game was called Demertia and I had planned on it being a memory game with some articles and research on dementia.  The user could pick up the article, flip through it and put on the shelf in the right order. I changed this idea due to time to a simple Ikea game where they try setting up the scene. The controls are pretty straightforward. The user can pick up and object, rotate or delete it then drop it in the scene. Afterwards they can press a button to get a percentage accuracy on how close they were with the picture provided. I chose the design for an Ikea warehouse cause my roommate had brought home some Ikea meatballs while I was still trying to figure out the design. 

What was challenging

JAVASCRIPT. ITS SO TECHNICAL. I had to ask my brother who is really good with web development for help when it came to the code for parenting the objects to the camera. That pick up and drop code took me about a week to finally get it working. Also for some reason, it takes a while for the page to load and you have to keep reloading it for it to work. And it doesn’t work on safari for desktop but works perfectly for safari on iPad and iPhone. Lastly, I ended up overusing my grok bandwidth and don’t have access to it anymore till march 1st.

What went well

The Model loading in and getting the percentage was really straightforward. I got some help from a stack overflow post who had a similar issue of getting the range of a position then calculating the percentage using a tolerance variable. Overall this was a really fun assignment and I’m looking forward to the term project.
